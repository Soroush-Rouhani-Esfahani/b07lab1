Brief overview of functions in Polynomial.java:

Polynomial():
  A constructor of the class, which serves to set the coefficients array to [0] which is the default value as per the lab handout.

Polynomial(double[] coefficientVals):
  A constructor of the class, which receives an array of doubles representing the desired coefficients of the polynomial as a parameter.
  If the parameter contains data, then the coefficients array is set to a copy of the array of doubles.
  If the parameter is null or empty, then the coefficients array is set to the default value of [0] to avoid errors.

public Polynomial add(Polynomial other):
  Receives another Polynomial as parameter, and returns a new Polynomial where the coefficients for each degree are the sum of this polynomial's and the other polynomial's coefficients for the respective degree.
  Null or empty coefficient arrays are treated as [0] for both Polynomials.

public double evaluate(double x):
  Receives a double x as parameter, and returns a double representing the value of the polynomial represented by this Polynomial at the given x.

public boolean hasRoot(double x):
  Receives a double x as parameter, Returns true if and only if the given x is a root of the polynomial represented by this Polynomial.
